# JsTD adapter for Karma a.k.a. use [Jasmine] ;-)

This fake API is basically a convertor to Jasmine - you call JsTD API, but it defines a Jasmine spec, so that you can keep your old JsTD tests and start writing new specs with Jasmine.

It's incomplete - just a prototype to prove the concept. Please implement more stuff if you need it and send a pull request...

[Jasmine]: https://jasmine.github.io/
